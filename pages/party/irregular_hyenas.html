          <p>
            I am Artimis, and I am a daughter of Thom Bosman and Hilyard
            Mainsman. They are rather successful merchants from the Krik river.
            Because of their patronage, I was able to attend the Wizarding
            school at the Hart Meer. There I found myself to have some aptitude
            with the psionic school of spells. Actually...great aptitude. But I
            was only able to study for so long before disaster struck my
            Father's business. They can no longer support my education at the
            university, and now I must travel back home through the Jungle van
            Riem. I was at least able to find an escort. I hope that my family
            is safe.

          <h3>Handre of Hegwaard</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes I must doubt the things I've heard. I'm really not from
            this continent. I was learning from the Gnomes on J'Dert when they
            suddenly prophesied that I needed to go to Nederska and restore
            balance to the...I don't know what they called it. I don't really
            speak Gnommish, and they kept babbling at me. I agreed to whatever
            it was, and they made me drink something. I think it was drugged,
            and I woke up on a boat. Well, now I'm here, shipped all the way to
            the Hart Meer, and they dropped me off with some Gnommish
            farewell...Shantel help me.

            Hi! Yes I'm a halfling, but at least I'm taller than my Mom! I have
            way to much of a story to tell here, but, to summarize: I have waay
            too many sisters, and we don't really get along. I am number 7 of
            twelve girls. Right about when Dad started despairing about my dowry
            ('cuz all my sisters older than me were all starting to make babies
            with their arranged hubbies) I decided that I was
            <em>not</em> wanting kids right then, and signed up for the army. I
            did some time up north fighting the orks. Those dwarves didn't care
            how short I was, just that I was good at fighting and drinking.
            Which I learned. But one of my teammates started making eyes at me,
            so I (officially) left the army and ran to Hart Meer.

          <h3>Mon-da-hir</h3>
          <p>
          I'm Mon-da-hir. I am elf, raisd by wolven. They teach me how to hunt,
          smel, and eat. One day I find big stick holding wolvbrother down. I
          pick up and kep. I use to smash smal goblin when they attacking us. We
          win. Goblin-folk get mad and find me. They chase me long way to big
          people city. I meet old elf Chohand'ler in big people city and he help
          me. I smart, and learn how read and rite. But then goblins find us.
          Too many. Old man Chohand'ler died. I kill some goblin-folk and run.
          Too many. I leave to bigger city. Lots of carts and people. I hear
          girl ask for guards help her get home, they say no. I clever, I think
          "Goblins think track me go north...I must go south." Girl home (her
          name Artmis) south, and I know way through the Riem. I help her find
          parents.
